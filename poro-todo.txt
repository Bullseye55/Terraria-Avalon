Dark Matter Biome:

Dark Matter Ooze never spawns more than 250 in a given biome area of effect.
If the number of  Dark Ooze goes above 350, the Dark Ooze turns reinforced, and can't be mined with a Picksaw.
The Dark Matter then spreads throughout the world, but always starting first from the reinforced Dark Matter.
Within 10 Terraria days time, all Dark Matter starts to spread in the world, starting a total conversion.
The Dark Matter spreads over everything, every brick, every wood, every block.
It converts special blocks into their own Dark Matter variants, such as Dark Matter Dungeon bricks. Yet to be sprited.


The Dungeon will be transformed into the Dark Matter Womb. Much tougher enemies spawn here compared to the majority of the world.
The Jungle grass and mud will be trasformed into Dark Matter Wastelands. The Wastelands grows a wide variety of junk.
This junk can then be recycled for resources, most resources coming from a pre-Dark Matter world. This biome is essential.

Dark Eye: An eye tile that spawns on the walls, floors, and celings on the Dark Matter Womb.
The direction it is looking determines what direction it fires if the player stands in its line of sight.
In essentially, a tile that attacks the player on its own, and can't be deactivated by snipping the wire.
They grow in the Womb.

More info coming later. I've gave you the basics, Poro.
